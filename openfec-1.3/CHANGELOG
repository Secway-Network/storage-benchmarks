OpenFEC.org project CHANGELOG

APRIL 13th, 2012 : release of openfec 1.3.0

- solved a bug in generate_curves.pl when using prepared statements (thanks to the forum's users)
- changed the licence of the LDPC-Staircase codec: now it is under the CECILL
- solved a bug in the LDPC-Staircase codec: if N1 is even, the lastest repair symbol can be null. Now, it is possible to check if it's the case


March 3rd, 2011 : release of openfec 1.2.2

- added some statistics about built/rebuilt/ignored symbols in IT and ML decoding.
- solved a bug in eperftool to use the "LDPC from file" codec
- eperftool : now, you can test codecs with callbacks for source and repair symbols creation.
- various bug corrections

Dec 3rd, 2010: release of openfec 1.2.1

- we solved a bug in of_[rs_|rs_2_m_]set_available_symbols(): shift wasn't done on a buffer (thanks Rakis).

---

Dec 3rd, 2010 : release of openfec 1.2.0

Major release : 
- we added a new optimized Reed-Solomon codec over 2^m (with m=4,8).
  Using m=4 is interesting for very small blocks (since k<n<=15), and is slightly faster than using m=8 in that case.
- Reed-Solomon over 2^m have both beem highly optimized and are approximatively 25 % faster than the original Reed-Solomon over GF(2^8) of previous release.
- Reed-Solomon over GF(2^8) still exists and has been optimized. It is 20 % faster than that previous release.
- added rs_m parameter for eperftool and for simulations (i.e there is a new entry in the params.txt file)
- Removed SSE optimization for 32bits machines. See forum for details (thanks Rakis).
- various bug corrections

Sept 16th, 2010 : release of openfec 1.1.0

This is a major release. Main changes include:
- Factorization of the binary linear system decoding code.
  The new structure now distinguishes, in a separate directory:
  - IT (iterative) decoding code,
  - ML (maximum likelihood) decoding code,
  - Binary matrix management code.
- Various code improvements and bug corrections.
Note that the API did not change, this version being fully
backward compatible with existing applications.

July 2nd, 2010 : first release of openfec 1.0.0 beta

This is the first release:
- It contains the following codecs :
    * LDPC-Staircase codec
    * Reed-Solomon GF(256) codec
    * 2D parity codec
    * LDPC from file codec
- It also contains an advanced simulation environment to let
  you perform easily many different kinds of tests.
